    My name is Brandon Hicks. I am a web developer from New Mexico, USA. The current majority of my current projects are done as a hobbyist, for small businesses, and applying my skills and consulting at local shops.

    I begin programming/scripting by working on numerous Basic, Java, and PHP projects for a number of years. Before  becoming completely disgusted with how terrible it was reading other peoples messes. I began outgrow the languages I was working with, and to crave something more from a language; enjoyment, readibility, and fun. That was until I took a major leap and jumped into the wonderful world of programming with Ruby and its various frameworks (Rails/Sinatra).

    I am currently obsessed with travel, improving my health, startups, beautiful and clean design, and first and foremost my family and children. When the sun sets and I'm able to relax, I step into another pair of shoes where I'm an avid reader, enthusiast of deviant design, and an addict of the Ruby language.

    This is a personal space for me to write about things that I have experienced, personal interests, helpful hints on tasks I've performed, and opinionated rants. Because of this, my posts may vary considerably on the content and state-of-mind in the content.
