  <p>
    My name isÂ <em class="fn">Brandon Hicks</em>. I am a web developer from New Mexico, USA. At I am currently employed at Budget Rent~A~Car (I'm not working as a developer). The current majority of my current projects are done as a hobbyist, for small businesses, and applying my skills and consulting at local shops.
  </p>
  <p>
    I worked on numerous PHP projects for several years, before becoming completely disgusted  with it because of how ugly my code looked and the constant arounds, and hacks to get anything done. A few years ago I took a major leap and jumped ship, I am now a fond devote of the of scripting in Ruby and its various frameworks (Rails/Sinatra).
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently obsessed with travel, improving my health, startups, beautiful and clean design, and first and foremost my family and children. When the sun sets and I'm no longer in absolute daddy mode; I'm an avid reader, enthusiast of deviant design, and an addict of the Ruby language.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a personal space for me to write about things that I have experienced, personal interests, helpful hints on tasks I've performed, and opinionated rants. Because of this, my posts may vary considerably on the content and state-of-mind in the content.
  </p>
