      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lets to work on using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ddollar/foreman&quot;&gt;Foreman&lt;/a&gt; and when I say Foreman I’m not referring to Eric Forman the goof for a son on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165598/?ref_=nv_sr_1&quot;&gt;The 70’s Show&lt;/a&gt;. I’m talking about the Ruby gem Foreman for making your applications easier to manage and deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vlQFjab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Eric Forman&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with Foreman it is a way to initialize your application and its components without making a mess. Before I started using this wonderful gem, whenever I would want to test and/or run an application I would have numerous tabs open and start numerous tasks in order to even get started (Rails Server, Sidekiq, etc.). But with foreman this can all be done with a single command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/before_foreman_tabs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Before Foreman&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Foreman all you need to do is install the gem, create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; and put your desired tasks in it. A Profile will contain the designated tasks which you wish to have initiated when you begin the application. An example of starting the rails server with foreman could look something similar to the following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;web: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or if you wish to call you server application specifically you can use something similar to the example below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;web: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;thin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what you’re thinking, “But wait this doesn’t change anything, this is just another file to put into my Rails applications directory.” But let me explain a little bit, every new line that you add to the Profile can have a task followed by it’s specific command that you would normally use in the command line. For example say you run Resque, Solr, Guard, or a number of other tasks when you run your server, add these tasks and they will start with the server when you run the foreman command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;web:    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;thin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;solr:   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rake&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sunspot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:solr:run&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;worker: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rake&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resque&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:work&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;QUEUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;guard:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;guard&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now instead of having 4 or 5 different tabs open for your terminal all you need to type in the command line is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;foreman start&lt;/code&gt; and you are ready to go. Below is an example of something similar that you will be output when setup and ran properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;master!$ &lt;/span&gt;foreman start
18:14:06 web.1     | started with pid 1247
18:14:06 sidekiq.1 | started with pid 1248
18:14:12 web.1     | &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; Booting Thin
18:14:12 web.1     | &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; Rails 4.2.0 application starting &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;development on http://localhost:3000
18:14:12 web.1     | &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; Run &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;rails server -h&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;more startup options
18:14:12 web.1     | &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; Ctrl-C to shutdown server
18:14:12 web.1     | Thin web server &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;v1.6.3 codename Protein Powder&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
18:14:12 web.1     | Maximum connections &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set &lt;/span&gt;to 1024
18:14:12 web.1     | Listening on localhost:3000, CTRL+C to stop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Foreman has been a wonderful resource for developing applications and initiating everything I need in order to jump into development mode. Foremen is not only used for development, it also has numerous features built in it for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ddollar/foreman/wiki/Exporting-for-production&quot;&gt;production&lt;/a&gt; uses as well. Including but not limited to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;foreman export&lt;/code&gt; commands which creates application initialization for upstart and linux (using /etc/init) upon starting or rebooting of your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setting Goals for 2015</title>
      <link>http://theworkaround.com/2014/12/27/setting-goals-for-2015.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <author> ( {"email"=>"tarellel@gmail.com", "name"=>"Brandon Hicks", "github"=>"tarellel", "twitter"=>"tarellel"} )</author>
      <guid>http://theworkaround.com/2014/12/27/setting-goals-for-2015</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once again the new year is upon us, goals should be set in order to help us look forward to achieving something rather than just watching time pass us by. We also need to sit down and look at what we’ve actually done within the last year. Have I wasted more time that I should have, of course we all have. But have we taken the necessary steps to get done what we wanted to? Probably not, we’ve started in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing&quot;&gt;Writing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the next year I plan on increasing my blgo posts dramatically. I plan on going from a skimming post every few months, to hopefully as much as a I can. I’m setting a goal of one every few weeks. And not just when I want to express myself, but when I learn and/or try something new that may help other people as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;productivity&quot;&gt;Productivity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all do it, we get out of our groove and get stuck in a rut, so we play games, read blog posts, browe reddit,twitter, facebook, or whatever else. And it takes an actual act of God to get us back to what needs to be done. And after those hours, days, and/or weeks were wasted we have huge regets or not having anything to show for it. I plan on managing my time better, getting more done, and actually releasing a few of my projects into production stage. Rather than working late nights, getting nothing done, and having nothing to show for all my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;family&quot;&gt;Family&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all got family (well a lot of us), we know how it feels having to drop everying in the middle of a project, right when your getting your groove. Just to find out you were called away just to see someones XBOX instant replay or tie a shoe. I love my kids and plan on trying to give them the utmost attention and love that I can this year. Even if it takes away from my productivity and/or learning. They don’t stay young forever and once they hit their teen years who wants to spent time with their parents anyways, right? I want to enjoy my children while I can.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Slimming Down</title>
      <link>http://theworkaround.com/2014/11/05/slimming-down.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <author> ( {"email"=>"tarellel@gmail.com", "name"=>"Brandon Hicks", "github"=>"tarellel", "twitter"=>"tarellel"} )</author>
      <guid>http://theworkaround.com/2014/11/05/slimming-down</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used Slim on various projects and have grown to thoroughly enjoy using it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://slim-lang.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Slim&lt;/a&gt; is a simple, lightweight, and fast Rails templating alternative to ERB or HAML. I prefer it over HAML because of it’s use of use and it takes almost nothing to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to been using Slim with your Rails application, simple add the following line to your Gemfile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;slim-rails&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And continue making your views as usual, but instead of using the file extension of &lt;code&gt;*.html.erb&lt;/code&gt; your being the file extension &lt;code&gt;*.html.slim&lt;/code&gt;. Than you can  begin formatting your views using the Slim syntax right away. It doesn’t take a magician playing tricks all night in order to get running, it has a very simple setup and the syntax is quite easy to grasp and get started on. If you know how to format views (using ruby and HTML) using Rails basic templating engine ERB, switch to Slim will be a piece of cake. And what makes it even easier is you can render layouts, partials, includes, etc. with both erb and Slim interchangeably. Say for example your applications primary layout is &lt;code&gt;application.html.erb&lt;/code&gt; you can include a partial: &lt;code&gt;header.html.slim&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparing-erb-and-slim&quot;&gt;Comparing ERB and Slim&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is Slim fast and clean, it’s quite a bit less cluttered than using erb. When using slim you simplify and clean up your templates and allow for a much more readable structure and tag hierarchy. For example compare the following examples&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# ERB
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;candylist&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@candy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;candy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;candy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Slim&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;candylist&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@candy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;candy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;candy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no matter which option you choose to go with, they both output the exact same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;candylist&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Jaw Breaker&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Lollipop&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Pop Rocks&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Skittles&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Slim template engine removes the complexities and unnecessary clustering of tags associated with using ERB. Slim is very concise, free flowing, and easy to read. Look at the example above and tell me it isn’t dead simple to understand exactly what is going on without a ton of extra tags. Another great thing I absolutely love is, Whitespace Matters! Some may argue “blah blah blah, this is to much like Python and kills the whole concept of ERB/Ruby”. Well if you’re already writing legible and structured code in the first place, than you should already be indenting and tabbing to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bad-example&quot;&gt;Bad Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Slim&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;splash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;World&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Outputs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&quot;splash&quot;&amp;gt;Hello World&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;better-example&quot;&gt;Better Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Slim&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;splash&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;World&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Outputs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;splash&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you into all the big buzz words flying around, just think of it as the CoffeeScript, Sass, Less, or any other abstraction engine except for HTML. It’s quick, clean, and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Background processing is an important feature with any web application to improve performance.&lt;br /&gt;
Not only does it free up your application for requests, it can be used to prioritize tasks and delay processes until your system has available resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is not about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job&quot;&gt;delayed_job&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/&quot;&gt;beanstalkd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mperham/girl_friday&quot;&gt;girl_friday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch&quot;&gt;sucker_punch&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/Background_Jobs&quot;&gt;wide selection&lt;/a&gt; of other background processors.&lt;br /&gt;
Even though I’ve used delayed_job which is amazingly easy to setup and use, I don’t exactly want to clog up my ActiveRecord database with database queries. The use of a key-value store tends to make things fast and simple as it is.&lt;br /&gt;
For background jobs, caching, and various other tasks Redis does an amazing job: it’s fast, reliable, and does over complicate the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently I had been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/resque/resque&quot;&gt;Resque&lt;/a&gt; the Holy Grail of Ruby based background processors and it has worked flawlessly to the needs I required.&lt;br /&gt;
But one of the applications I have setup allows users to upload as many images (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave&quot;&gt;Carrierwave&lt;/a&gt;) as they want at any given time.&lt;br /&gt;
Upon successful upload of these images the files mime-types and extensions are verified to ensure that malicous files aren’t being uploaded to the server.&lt;br /&gt;
Than the images are processed to create thumbnails, gallery images, etc. and when you’re processing numerous image files at one time without background processing this absolutely bogs down a server.&lt;br /&gt;
When you have some a mechanism to do this effecively in the background this doesn’t have such a huge impact. But as of lately with a higher user base the image uploads have begin to display delayes in their processing times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may not seem like much, but when it’s a few images here and there from numerous users at any given time, the processing time begins to add up.&lt;br /&gt;
Especially when upon upload a thumbnail is generated and expected to be displayed almost immediately showing the available uploads for use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One great thing about Sidekiq is that just like Resque it uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://redis.io/&quot;&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt;, if you’ve never used Redis before, please do us all a favor and at least give a quick try.&lt;br /&gt;
Compared to large SQL databases it’s very simple (key/value pair) and extremely fast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/redis-store/redis-rails&quot;&gt;some people&lt;/a&gt; have gone as far to use it for caching, sessions, and various other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amazing part that makes this migration from Resque to Sidekiq fast and easy is that both libraries use Redis as their backend database to keep track of queues/tasks.&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of the gems and initializers just require that you to change the backend from resque to sidekiq, while others just adjust to detecting what’s available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# carrierwave_backgrounder&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:resque&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:sidekiq&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# devise-async&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Async&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:resque&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Async&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:sidekiq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to get everything working propely with your gems only slight adjustments are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Gemfile&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#gem &#39;resque&#39;, :require =&amp;gt; &quot;resque/server&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;sidekiq&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:github&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;mperham/sidekiq&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;devise-async&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;carrierwave_backgrounder&#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# And if your using it for caching, sessions, etc.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;redis-rails&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance wise, I have have noticed a significant increase in processing speed. Resque and delayed_job were produced when Ruby/Rails was&lt;br /&gt;
hitting a massive explosion of growth something was needed and needed fast. Don’t get me wrong Resque is an amazing ruby gem, but if your&lt;br /&gt;
application is using thread-safe libraries Sidekiq will kick quite a punch when it comes to your background processes.&lt;br /&gt;
Upon benchmarking, Sidekiq tends to significantly outperform Resque when it comes to completing background processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;goworker&quot;&gt;GoWorker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing as how lately I’ve been dealing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://golang.org/&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; not only for it smooth edge, but compiled libraries tent to perform significantly faster than interpreted languages, another option I considered (and still am looking into is) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goworker.org/&quot;&gt;goworker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Goworker is pretty much a drop in replacement for Resque and Sidekiq, relies on Redis as well and massively out performed them both.&lt;br /&gt;
But before I attempt to push this any faster and milk every drop of performance out of the application, I plan to learn quite a bit more about programming with Go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Saturation of a Technologies</title>
      <link>http://theworkaround.com/2014/07/06/the-saturation-of-technologies.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author> ( {"email"=>"tarellel@gmail.com", "name"=>"Brandon Hicks", "github"=>"tarellel", "twitter"=>"tarellel"} )</author>
      <guid>http://theworkaround.com/2014/07/06/the-saturation-of-technologies</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started coding I was quite a bit younger, and has a passion to learn every possible tech related thing I possibly could. I was going to school, working a part time job, needed very little sleep, and quite the introvert. I had a programmers dream environment build up around myself. It was a genuine passion to learn, learn, and learn some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was going to college, I saw people who were going through the Computer Science/IT programs that had never even viewed a script other than to copy and paste to modify their MySpace. These people thought they were amazing, they could change the background or font-color of their profile page. They suddenly thought they were gifted prodigies with computers, hoping to be amazing programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In class a few of them stuck with the material, but very few of them enjoyed it. Even fewer of these people actually practiced any sort of coding outside of the school material. Almost no one ever went in depth to learn the languages, linux systems, or every got curious about the systems we were working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was in the very least, quite a disturbing revelation. You want to make a career out of developing software, yet you don’t want to learn anything other than the skimmed examples in the book?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do understand that not everyone has the time to heavily dedicate to a given subject. (I have a family, kids, and a job this is fully understandable). Sometimes I get so tired of work, chores, worries, and everything I can’t even sit down and look at code. It’s nice to sometimes just burn everything away and fidget with a hobby or stare in my massive fish tank and relax for a bit. And sometimes just coding or refactoring a few lines of code is enough to relax my like a good nights sleep and I’ll spring to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you’re trying to make a career in a specific field, I honestly believe you need to have a passion for it in the first place. I understand that when you’re in the technology field there’s alot of pressure to spend every waking moment learning, studing, and creating in your field of expertise. Some technologist only learn what is required of them at their jobs, the bare minimum. And what works for them may not work for others, obviously the passion and desire isn’t always there. They’ve got job security until they’ve got the train that new college grad years down the road and be their manager, switch fields, or retire. And some people try to learn and create in every little nitch that they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve grown older I’ve learned it not solely about dedicating every moment you’ve got to your studies, it’s about learning to sift to sift through all the fads and learn what is required to work for you. Let it be: Swift, Dart, Go, Angular, Ember, AWS, one of the dozens of NoSQL databases coming out each weel, Python, Ruby, the newest Web Framework and flashiest, Responsive Design, the list could go on forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned you need to focus on learning the big picture, you don’t need to learn every language out there. It’s important to stick to a language you like or need and get to be good at it. Especially considering once you’ve learned the the concepts of on language very well, you generally understand the basics of numerous other technologies and languages. And once you have got a fine grasp on things, it’s quite  easier to begin learning other things. Just don’t overwhelm yourself with fads, trends, the newest and coolest language. And before you jump into a new technology, take a moment to think: where do you think it’ll be in 5, 7, or even 10 years from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will learning X or Y give you an “in-demand” skill? Will JavaScript continue to take over the development world or will there be something new to push it aside? Will those late nights pay off? Have we reached our saturation point, where we no longer want to learn the newest tool and only stick to what we know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can only hope the paths we have chosen to follow, the skills we have learned, and technologies we have adapted won’t be the thing that causes us regret and worries years down the road. And that the skills what we’ve decided to learn we’ll still be able to pay the bills, support our families, and enjoy our careers with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nurture It Like a Garden</title>
      <link>http://theworkaround.com/2013/05/26/nurture-it-like-a-garden.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2013 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author> ( {"email"=>"tarellel@gmail.com", "name"=>"Brandon Hicks", "github"=>"tarellel", "twitter"=>"tarellel"} )</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/grape_bunch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alt text&quot; title=&quot;Kumquat Tree&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of recently I have been building and growing a small vegetable garden for my family. My children love the idea of putting&lt;br /&gt;
work into it something quite so amazing: digging up the dirt, playing the seeds and plant buds, watering, and taking responsibility for a small living object that will someday be rewarding them for their effort.&lt;br /&gt;
But in the meantime they have to put time, effort, and tender love and care into taking care of the plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very much like any project you may work on. It usually starts out as a small idea, like planting a seed in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begins by putting a lot of effort into turning that idea into something real, that idea begins to grow into something fruitful and full of life. But in order for your idea to grow into something big and wonderful you need to take care of it, feed it, nourish it, and look after it until it flourishes into something wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;
But once it’s alive and growing you can’t just forget about it. You have to look after it, tend to it, make sure it doesn’t get out of control, and is well fed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an application has reached a satisifing level of use and income you don’t just forget about it and hope it can maintain&lt;br /&gt;
itself for the long run. Trends and technology are always advancing, needs, requirements, and desires are always growing.&lt;br /&gt;
One day your application my be the top of its category and tomorrow it could be a long forgotten memory of the past (just&lt;br /&gt;
look at how fast the social web has jumped around in the past few years). In other words, if you believe in your idea and&lt;br /&gt;
dreams don’t let it dwindle and die. Build that idea, make it more than a dream, make it into something that will be used&lt;br /&gt;
by someone other than yourself. Success isn’t achieved by just planting the seeds, you have to be patient and maintain&lt;br /&gt;
the foundation of what you’ve build.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Truth of It All</title>
      <link>http://theworkaround.com/2013/05/20/the-truth-of-it-all.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2013 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author> ( {"email"=>"tarellel@gmail.com", "name"=>"Brandon Hicks", "github"=>"tarellel", "twitter"=>"tarellel"} )</author>
      <guid>http://theworkaround.com/2013/05/20/the-truth-of-it-all</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know it’s been asked time and time again, “What do you want in the long run out of your life?” We all have hopes and dreams we want to fulfill, different routes we&lt;br /&gt;
want to take through life. But we’re all (well most of us) going to end up the same in the end. We’ll either be stuffed&lt;br /&gt;
away like a number in a nursing home or living with out children/grandchildren and feeling bad about them having to help&lt;br /&gt;
manage our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality of this question is, its’ not as easy of an answer as it seems. And as you live your life and experience new things&lt;br /&gt;
your answer will change. When your young and stupid you want fame and money, but as you age and become more mature you&lt;br /&gt;
want happiness and health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our outcome in life isn’t always what we’d want it to be. But in the meantime, it’s about making the most you can out of what you love doing.&lt;br /&gt;
The reason many people goto college, participate in training seminar, start a hobby, etc. is because they want to spend the bulk of their life doing what they’re passionate about.&lt;br /&gt;
You don’t necessarily have to be a millionaire living extravagantly or a philanthropist in order to be happy. But you do want to look back and&lt;br /&gt;
tell people you did something amazing with your life, that you weren’t just a couch potato sitting back coasting through life and always hoping for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment my children and fiance, are my number one priorities. But I am still passionate about what makes me happy, with keeps my mind going, and something that pushes my limits.&lt;br /&gt;
If you’re deeply passionate about an interest, you don’t just make it a hobby, don’t think about pushing it aside and saying it’s just a phase.&lt;br /&gt;
Think about diving head first into it, make a life out of doing what you enjoy. And creating a stable life for you and your family in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
